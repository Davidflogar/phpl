- FunctionCall expression
- Add exceptions instead of stopping the program with any fatal error
- Pass and return by reference in functions
- Validate the data types that are supported in an Intersection (from the parser)
- You should not be able to use ellipsis in functions like empty or isset
- Only the last parameter can be variadic in all functions (from the parser)
- Avoid repeated argument names in functions and constructors
- Make it possible to perform only arithmetic operations on the appropriate data types and not attempt to convert data types.
